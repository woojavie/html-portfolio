<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Javier! I am a Kinesiology graduate from the University of Toronto exploring the field of Computer Science. I love to play sports such as Ice Hockey and Basketball, and I am an avid concert goer. Some fun facts about me are that I did an internship in Hong Kong with a fintech company after graduating, I run a Tiktok account with my girlfriend rating different study spots around Vancouver, and I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under a minute. Join me on this journey as I learn this fascinating field of science!</p>
